        # so if we reduce each array against ITSELF (a 2n operation)
        # and then figure out if that zeros out by checking whether the
        # other array's length is even or odd, we can  "compress" the
        # info down such that you don't nave to do the m*n operation of
        # computing the exclusive or of each pair.
